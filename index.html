	<div class="inmid"><h1 class="passion">About Me</h1>
	    <p class="essay">   I'm a 19 year old boy with extraordinary dreams, and with a infinite love in science. I compare myself to the stars that shine and sparkle in the moonlit sky. When the stars are out and shining bright, people will look in awe and exclaim how beautiful they are, and how lucky they are to have a universe as beautiful and mystic as it is. In a strange way I feel like the tiniest star there. We may play a small role in life, but that gives people no right to use us, and take us for granted. One day they will look up to the sky, and though they won't notice, that star will be gone.
The same for me. One day someone will come to me, and I will no longer be here. I may play a very small role in life, but one day I will make a difference. Like the universe I am subject to change. When I do I will broaden my horizons and make some changes. I can only hope it will make a difference in life.I was different from the very beginning. I grew up differently. When I was happy, I always sang songs nobody knew because I made them up in my mind. I have experiences nobody can share with me. Nobody grew up like I did. I grew up differently. 

I still am. Different, I mean. I have all those pictures in my head, almost my whole life. Everything I see is like a picture stream in my head. I think I can keep those pictures better than other people. Other people forget those little details. I don't. I like to watch the people in the underground and try to imagine their life. Others wouldn't even realise them. I can look at a dirty wall or an uneven stone and suddenly I see faces or animals in those patterns of nature, although they are not really there. Other people would think I'm insane if I'd tell them what I see. And what I see becomes stuck as a picture in my head. 

I am so different because the pictures in my head get so many and sometimes I have the feeling that they'll make my head go off. So I have to get them out of my head. Therefore, I put them on a piece of paper. I write them down. I write what I saw once. Or I draw. Sometimes I even put those pictures in the music I make and share them with people. And then they don't call me insane anymore. my childhood went like this.

But thinks were changed, me too. now I can't even see those pictures. haha! what a life. besides all these, I want it to be unreasonable, unpredictable and not at all comparable with any other life on this earth.

    <div class="inmid2"><h1 class="passion">Passion</h1>
	    <p class="essay">   The definition of passion is a powerful emotion. These emotions can include love,
             joy, hatred or anger. Passion can drive people to do the best things in life, or it can drive
             people to do the most terrible things possible in life. Passion is an important factor in
             every single soul on earth. Passion drives me, and many others to achieve goals in life. I
             have passion in my life to do the best I can in all I do and make the best out of every
             experience. My life has many things that involve endurance of passion. Maintaining the
             drive is the only obstacle that I come across. Each day isfilled with some new drama or task that needs to be taken care of. Those tasks may include many little problems such as if we are stuiding we have homework, test,
             appearance, and self-esteem issues. It's very difficult to find the energy to get out of bed each and every morning, but with
             encouragement given by friends and even some others, everyone can make it.
             Being involved in sports and activities is something I have always enjoyed
             and experienced It takes a lot of passion to go to all of the practices and
             performances when usually it does not benefit me at all. Lately I have lost most of my
             passion because I lost hope in seeing the point at all anymore.
             It is very difficult to go into a depressing environment where yelling and discouragements
             are common. I do love exercising because it keeps me fit, but I also have a passion for
             sleeping.
         My greatest aim is happiness, or at least the shape of happiness. I try to reach it every day.

		But now, after all that, I slowly start to matter in your brain because you begin to remember what you just read about me and you think about me. Maybe you start to search and find pictures in your head, banned into an empty corner. You start to share them and then a sudden feeling of irrationality overwhelms you and you decide to visit your grandma and share ten cups of self-made frozen yogurt with her. You forget your future and live in the present. And maybe you even get to tell somebody that you love him or her, somebody of whom you thought up to this point: “It's either unreasonable or unrealistic.” 

		And see: This is the point where I am different and I start to matter for you, This is the point where I could give you an impression of my way of living and the point where you (maybe in a long time) again feel the happiness pushing out of you.</p></div>
